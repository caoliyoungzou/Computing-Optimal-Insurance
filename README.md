# Optimal-Insurance-to-Maximize-Exponential-Utility-When-Premium-Is-Computed-by-a-Convex-Functional
# Introduction
This MATLAB source code contains three examples demonstrating the implementation of an algorithm for computing optimal insurance when the premium is calculated using a convex functional. The algorithm is proposed in our paper “Optimal Insurance to Maximize Exponential Utility When Premium Is Computed by a Convex Functional”. We are sharing these examples with the aim of enabling other members of the research community to reproduce examples in the paper and to apply the algorithm in computing additional examples.
