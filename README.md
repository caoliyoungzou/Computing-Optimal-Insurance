# Optimal-Insurance-to-Maximize-Exponential-Utility-When-Premium-Is-Computed-by-a-Convex-Functional
# Introduction
This MATLAB source code contains three examples demonstrating the implementation of an algorithm for computing optimal insurance when the premium is calculated using a convex functional. We are sharing these examples with the aim of enabling other members of the research community to reproduce our results and  to apply the algorithm in computing additional examples.
