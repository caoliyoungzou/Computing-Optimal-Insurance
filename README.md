# Optimal-Insurance-to-Maximize-Exponential-Utility-When-Premium-Is-Computed-by-a-Convex-Functional
# Introduction
This MATLAB source code contains three examples demonstrating the implementation of an algorithm for computing optimal insurance premiums when the premium is calculated using a convex functional. We are sharing these examples with the aim of enabling other members of the research community to apply the algorithm in computing additional examples.
